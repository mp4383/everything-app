# EVERYTHING
I am creating an everything app to consolidate the things I do into my own local/internet hybrid. I have several goals
* create a friend only social network similar to twitter. no ads, no reliance on big corp/social media.
    - the app will have one feed for twitter like posts then allow group chat feature to allow the invite of other people
    - at a certain phase I want to implement voting to allow people onto the platform. For this reason, we will require solana wallets for authentication unless something else is better
    - we will also introduce a solana l2 coin to reward users for various functions
    - the crypto functionality should be prepared for but not immediately implemented. we need to get the social network working first, but can use solana addresses for auth starting out
* track and manage stock and crypto performance
* download videos from facebook in 1080p and provide library similar to youtube. storage runs off of nas.
* strategize personal learning objectives and create a learning path
* integrate an ai agent
* create an automated bot that is scraping news for various areas of interest and can inform event based trading 
    - create simulations of various bots that are paper trading according to events that are being tracked. track lessons learned building towards eventual realtime trading

## Design
* should use modularity as much as possible. things should be resizable, movable, etc
