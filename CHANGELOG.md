### Technical Decisions
1. Using Material-UI for:
   - Consistent component styling
   - Built-in responsiveness
   - Theme customization
   - Accessibility features

2. Component Structure:
   - Each component in separate file for maintainability
   - Shared styling through theme
   - Mock data separated for easy replacement with real data

3. Layout Strategy:
   - Grid-based layout for flexibility
   - Component containers with consistent styling
   - Sticky headers for better navigation
   - Scrollable content areas for overflow

### Notes
- Keep component backgrounds white for clean look
- Use consistent spacing (8px increments)
- Maintain border radius consistency (8px)
- Use light borders for subtle definition
- Center standalone views (like SocialFeed) at 600px width
